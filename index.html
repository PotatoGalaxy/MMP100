		<h1>BELIEVE IT!</h1>
		<p>Susan Liu is a student at CUNY BMCC and is currently trying to graduate with an associates's degree in Pyschology. As a pyschology student, she is learning the basics of human behavior and their way of thinking. Susan has also started participating in class discussions to help get her out of her shell. A few months previously, she graduated secondary school from Frank Sinatra School of the Arts. There, she majored as a Fine Art student and developed a bit of knowledge of different art mediums. Growing up, Liu's family encouraged her to continue, hence why she went to the specialized high school in the first place. Getting older she was finding herself leaning towards the careers that involved science, animals, people and art. She came to an agreement with herself to pursue in Art Therapy; tackling a career that has both people and art interests. She still keeps other options open in case Art Therapy isn't the right career for her. Liu never thought she would get this far. The support and proudness of her parents are one of the reasons why she decided to go to college. She is attending college for herself and to branch out of her comfort zone. So far, she has developed into a more focused and determined student. She claims that everyone will see that she followed her dreams through may it be as an Art Therapist, a Herbalist or someone who handles with animals. Susan Liu will attend many semesters, and receive many degrees; Belive it!
