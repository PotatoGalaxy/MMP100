	<p>Sasuke Uchiha is a fictional character in the Naruto Series and Anime franchise created by Masashi Kishimoto.(I been wishing for him to be real since I was 6, but you know lol.) Sasuke was a happy child,eager to please and be worthy of his family name.This changed after his entire family was massacred by his older brother Itachi. He became cold toward others,unmoved by and uninterested in what they do or think of him,choosing instead to keep to himself.Feelings of powerlessness forces him to abandon his village and quest to become stronger wih the help of Orochimaru.</p>
